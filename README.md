Dataset should be downloaded and unzipped before running the program.

The main file is called 'budowa_krok_1_2.ipynb' (without the underscore at the end)
some functions are commented by defaul. Those are the functions that modify the dataset and should only be *RUN ONCE*.
Be patient - they may take a while to do their thing (there are over 3000 photos after all)
